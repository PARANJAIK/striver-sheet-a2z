Never expect that you are going to solve all problems easily, always you will be in trouble solving a problem continuosly and that's okay, just cool, give it a try, a try ,a
try and a try, and then just enter it in the to try again notes. 

Understand that you have got lot to learn, which improves you ability by a higher extent that day if you are not able to solve the problems.

If unable to solve the problems and fred up, don't leave, do problems of lower difficulties. 


 Try to solve a problem:
1) If the problem gets solved: See editorial and learn, see successfull submissions of pros and learn.
2) If the problem don't get solved: See editorial and try again: 
                                    i) if solved: happy and see successfull submissions of pros and learn.
                                    ii) if not solved: try again later ....
